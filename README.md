# Pizza Tower Web Launcher
Pizza Tower Web Launcher for GX.GAMES

Made as a workaround to the GX.GAMES size limit, it launches My Pizza Tower 1.1.0 port from the GX.GAMES Platform by re-directing players to my website that hosts it

Source Code will be available if anyone wants to modify it to fit their needs
> [!NOTE]
> A .txt will be included with the code to help you understand how to replace the text and functionality of the launcher

### This was built off of Pizza Tower Online, and its Disclaimer Screen

so thanks to
- loypoll for the original PTO

All I really did was isolate all the necessary files related to the Disclaimer screen and modify them to work independent from useless and unnecessary scripts and files
> and of course to actually launch the game and even re-direct people to my Github page if they want to
